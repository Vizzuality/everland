It is home to more than 950 wild species, including 75 globally threatened species, and is also the ancestral home of the indigenous Bunong people, whose unique culture and beliefs are inseparable from the forest in which they live. Originally designated as a protected area in 2002, KSWS is managed by the Royal Government of Cambodia’s Ministry of Environment, with technical and financial support from WCS Cambodia.",

        "description": "In the early 1970s most of the population of the 20 villages within the project area (then almost entirely made up of Bunong families) was relocated out of the area during the Khmer Rouge regime, with survivors and their children returning progressively as security improved during 1979–1998. In-migration of Khmer people has taken place along with the return of the Bunong to their traditional lands, in response to employment opportunities stemming from logging concession activities, and the demobilization of around 200 ex-Khmer Rouge families in the late 1990s. Subsequently road improvements, ineffective enforcement of forest protection laws by the local authorities and other factors have promoted continued growth.<br/ ><br />The project area was formerly a logging concession, which ceased operations in 1999 as part of a national moratorium on logging concession operations. Subsequently, the area was placed under conservation protection through the creation of the Seima Protected Forest, . This has been reinforced by the 2009 Sub-decree declaring the SPF which reassigns the whole area to Protection Forest, a land category that does not permit timber concession operations. The existence of the concession contract is not believed to entitle Samling International to any role in the management or benefit-sharing arrangements for the Seima REDD+ project, a step that enabled REDD+ activities to commence in January 2010. Subsequently, in early 2016 the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a Sub-Decree No. 83 to establish the Keo Seima Wildlife Santuary (KSWS), and to transfer management authority for the areas to the Ministry of Environment (MoE).",

        "description": "Driven by expansion of cash crops and land speculation, Keo Seima sits at the frontier of a wave of deforestation that has swept through an adjacent, unsupported protected area and continues to advance. Illegal land clearance associated with this deforestation wave is currently Keo Seima’s greatest threat. Illegal hunting with guns, dogs, and snares is also a direct threat to wildlife species, and illegal targeted logging of valuable timber threatens rare tree species and causes community conflict.",

        "description": "Key components of this multi-faceted conservation project include reducing illegal activity through direct law enforcement; establishing community tenure and sustainable use of land and natural resources; supporting alternative livelihoods that reduce pressure on the forest; and developing legal and planning frameworks to guide long term management of the area. These are supported by effective monitoring and evaluation, effective administration to reduce overhead costs, and sustainable finance mechanisms to ensure long-term support.<br /><br />With long-term technical support from WCS, a clear set of goals, targets, and objectives have been defined for effective, equitable, and inclusive management of the protected area. Community teams support sustainable development by helping indigenous communities secure tenure; providing agriculture training; supporting alternative sustainable livelihoods such as ecotourism; and supporting education. Law enforcement teams apply Cambodia’s legal frameworks to reduce illegal activity. World class biodiversity monitoring and GIS teams measure the impact and effectiveness of these interventions on forest cover and wildlife populations, providing protected area mangers high quality data to inform management decisions.",

The project has emphasized recognition for the legal land rights of the indigenous Bunong people who live within the project area, and have helped secure Indigenous Community Land Titles (ICTs) for seven villages, with another six in progress. In addition, the project has brought IBIS Rice, a Wildlife Conservation Society initiative that offers price premiums to farmers who commit to no logging, hunting, or pesticides, and to protecting the landscape and its species, to 1,500 farmers. And the project’s impact on biodiversity has been documented through world class biodiversity monitoring, showing that more than 80% of monitored species trends matched or improved on the anticipated trends set in 2010 in the REDD+ Project Design Document. These results highlight the success and impacts of the project, while spotlighting where new conservation interventions are most urgently needed.",

The mobile health clinics were selected as high priority actions by the 5 participating villages (Pu Tang, Pu Keh, Gati, Pu Char and Pu Nhav), who funded the clinics with their REDD+ benefit sharing funds. Providing “free at the point of use” healthcare on-site in each village has significant positive impacts on the well-being of these communities, while also addressing an underlying driver of deforestation: medical debt.",

Farmers commit to no logging, hunting, or pesticides, protecting the landscape and its species. The rice is sold globally at a higher premium and provides a win-win scenario for communities and conservation, helping to diminish poverty and reducing deforestation by 75% where IBIS Rice farmers work. In KSWS, the IBIS Rice program is currently active in 3 REDD+ villages: Pu Kong, Pu Char and Ou Chra, with a total of 79 farmer households having joined the program and 13 successfully selling to IBIS Rice already.",
