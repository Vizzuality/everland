This area is globally significant for ecosystem servicing, wildlife conservation, and community livelihoods and serves as the region’s most important watershed, climate regulator and carbon sink. Using global best practices for forest protection and community development, the Southern Cardamom REDD+ project protects 497,000 hectares of this crucial tropical rainforest ecosystem in Southwest Cambodia.",

At the same time, anarchic slash and burn cultivation was destroying thousands of hectares of the forest area each month, leaving the Cardamom Rainforest on the brink of destruction. Tigers became entirely extinct from the landscape. It was at this time that the Wildlife Alliance came to the project area to conduct emergency interventions.<br /><br />Following the success of its initial work in reducing threats to the forest and wildlife, the Wildlife Alliance was asked to help design and implement a long term Protected Area Management Plan by the Royal Government of Cambodia to help protect the landscape, its forests and its wildlife.",

The Cardamom Rainforest Landscape is under perennial threat from these relentless forces.",

The effective field-level partnership between staff from the project, the Ministry of Environment, and the Military Police is a key ingredient of the project’s success. Rangers are well paid and receive life insurance and full health benefits, have the capacity and equipment to work effectively and safely, and are led and motivated by inspirational supervisors. This is critical to the success of the project, where a culture of excellence in conservation, zero tolerance for corruption and achieving high performance has been cultivated.<br /><br />The project also partners with communities and governments to generate sustainable income opportunities for the local community, and works with more than 15 villages to implement sustainable community-based ecotourism.",

Some community members have even resorted to collecting nearby river water, which is very often tainted by chemicals originating from upstream plantations. Through the project’s benefit sharing program, 18 solar-powered water wells have been distributed to 423 families in 2021 with a further 25 wells scheduled to be completed in 2022.

To alleviate the suffering these communities were facing, a Wildlife Alliance relief mission, supported by the Southern Cardamom REDD+ Project, travelled to the communities from Phnom Penh with crucial supplies to give to the villagers, including rice, dried fish, instant noodles and tents to the affected communities, giving aid to 453 families. Additional benefits sharing has been allocated to the development of new roads in 2021, as the current road network has been heavily eroded due to regular flooding and limited upkeep. An 18-km stretch of road from Por Boeung to Sre Ambel - which is particularly dangerous during the rainy season -  has been reconstructed at higher elevation with a new drainage system, allowing villages to access the Sre Ambel marketplace, district health facilities and the local secondary school.",

A high voltage power line had been planned to bring electricity from 4 hydro-power dams to Phnom Penh, which would have sliced through 4 National Parks and pristine, untouched rainforest over a 100 km distance. Not only would this fragment the wild habitat, but it would create access to previously remote rainforest, leaving much of the landscape vulnerable to land grabbing, logging and poaching. Wildlife Alliance engaged with government officials at the highest level and published an Environmental Impact Assessment that recommends an identified alternate route around the rainforest that is far less environmentally destructive. Thanks to Wildlife Alliance’s intervention, the Power Line project is currently halted and under review.",
