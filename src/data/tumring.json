  "projectInfo": "The Tumring REDD+ project protects 67,791 hectares of high-conservation-value tropical forest along the southwest border of the highly threatened Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary, a 430,000-hectare protected area that is one of Southeast Asia’s last major intact lowland forests. In a unique partnership between Cambodia’s Forestry Administration and local communities, community groups manage 14 Community Forests within the project area. Sustainable livelihoods are created from the responsible harvesting of mainly non-timber forest products. By helping local communities reap the social benefits of forest conservation and providing sustainable agriculture training and market support for families who agree to protect forests, Tumring is advancing a community-driven, market-based conservation solution that directly addresses the drivers of deforestation.",

The Project provided a solar-powered water pumping system to the Prey Sre Pring community, giving approximately 200 people access to a reliable source of water.  Having this water pumping system that provides safer and more reliable access to water means that community members--typically women and children--no longer need to travel far from the village to collect water, which was a dangerous trek during the rainy season that often saw flooding throughout the area. In addition to saving money and having improved safety conditions, the water system will better enable families to plant and maintain small gardens and provide water for cooking and cleaning.",

The project’s long-term strategy is to keep these resin trees standing and to help provide alternative income streams to the community through market links, reducing pressure on forest resources.",
